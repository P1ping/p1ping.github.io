I am a Master student in Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), supervised by [Yu Zhang](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/zhangyu.html) (previously by [Tom Ko](https://tomkocse.github.io/)). My current research focuses on *speech representation learning* and *speech synthesis*. I also have some experience in speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), during my internship at ByteDance AI Lab.

You can view my [CV](/cv) for more information. Feel free to contact me (12032871 [at] mail [dot] sustech [dot] edu [dot] cn) if you are interested in my work or have any questions. I am happy to discuss them with you!
