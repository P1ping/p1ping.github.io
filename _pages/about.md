I'm currently pursuing my PhD at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, under the guidance of Prof. Haizhou Li. My research primarily revolves around speech processing, encompassing areas such as speech representation learning, speech synthesis, and speech translation.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned my Bachelor's degree from Central South University, followed by a Master's degree from Southern University of Science and Technology. Throughout my Master's journey, I had the privilege of being mentored by Prof. Yu Zhang, Prof. Jimmy Liu, and Prof. Tom Ko.

I'm always open to discussing my research and answering any related queries. If you're interested in my work or are considering potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out to me at [qibingbai@link.cuhk.edu.cn](mailto:qibingbai@link.cuhk.edu.cn). I look forward to engaging in enriching discussions and exploring new opportunities.
